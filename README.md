# muonview

Prototype (take 2) of the MchView program of the CERN Alice Muon Spectrometer Collaboration.

This is a version where both the UI and the (Javascript) APIs (to serve e.g clusters and digits) are handled in a (small) mono-repo, using [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org). Individual packages are setup with [neutrinojs](https://neutrinojs.org)
